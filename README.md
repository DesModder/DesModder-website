title: DesModder Website
---

This repository is the website to be deployed at [desmodder.com](https://desmodder.com/).

This is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) project.

## Build Site Locally

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. See the site at `http://localhost:8080`

You sometimes have to run `npm run clean`: Eleventy doesn't delete files that should no longer exist.
